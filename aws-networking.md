**Detailed workflow for AWS networking** 

I’ll break this into **three layers**:

1. **High-Level Workflow** – the big picture from VPC creation to connectivity.
2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Flow** – exactly what happens and in what order.
3. **Operational Flow** – how traffic moves once the network is set up.

## **1. High-Level AWS Networking Workflow**

1. **Plan your network architecture**

   * Choose AWS **region(s)**.
   * Define **CIDR ranges** (IPv4 & optional IPv6).
   * Decide **how many Availability Zones** to use.
   * Plan for **public, private, and database subnets**.

2. **Create your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**

   * Assign a **CIDR block** (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).
   * Enable **DNS hostnames/resolution** if needed.

3. **Add subnets**

   * Split CIDR into **smaller ranges** per AZ.
   * Tag subnets as **public** or **private**.

4. **Attach an Internet Gateway (IGW)** (for public subnets).

5. **Add a NAT Gateway** (for private subnet outbound internet access).

6. **Configure Route Tables**

   * Public subnet → IGW.
   * Private subnet → NAT Gateway or VPC Peering.

7. **Set up Network Access Control**

   * **Security Groups** (instance-level).
   * **NACLs** (subnet-level).

8. **Enable connectivity to other networks**

   * **VPC Peering** (VPC-to-VPC).
   * **Transit Gateway** (multiple VPCs/On-premises).
   * **VPN / AWS Direct Connect** (to on-premises).

9. **Test network connectivity**.

## **2. Detailed AWS Networking Build Flow (Step-by-Step)**

**Step 1 – VPC Creation**

* Go to **VPC console** → Create VPC → Choose CIDR block → Enable DNS options.

**Step 2 – Subnet Creation**

* For each AZ: Create subnets (`10.0.1.0/24`, `10.0.2.0/24`, etc.).
* Decide which subnets will be **public** (IGW access) vs. **private**.

**Step 3 – Internet Gateway**

* Create IGW → Attach to VPC.
* Update public subnet’s route table with **0.0.0.0/0 → IGW**.

**Step 4 – NAT Gateway (Optional)**

* Create NAT Gateway in public subnet.
* Update private subnet’s route table with **0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway**.

**Step 5 – Route Tables**

* Public Route Table: Routes to IGW.
* Private Route Table: Routes to NAT Gateway or internal-only.

**Step 6 – Security Controls**

* Create Security Groups (e.g., Web SG allows port 80/443 from 0.0.0.0/0).
* Create NACLs for additional subnet-level rules.

**Step 7 – Advanced Networking (Optional)**

* VPC Peering (connects VPCs).
* Transit Gateway (central routing hub).
* VPN/Direct Connect (connect on-premises).
* VPC Endpoints (private AWS service access).

**Step 8 – Test & Monitor**

* Launch EC2 in public subnet → test internet.
* Launch EC2 in private subnet → test NAT.
* Use **VPC Flow Logs** for troubleshooting.

## **3. AWS Networking Operational Flow (How Traffic Moves)**

**Public Subnet EC2 → Internet**

1. Packet leaves EC2 → Security Group checks allow outbound.
2. Route table says **0.0.0.0/0 → IGW**.
3. IGW translates to/from public IP.

**Private Subnet EC2 → Internet**

1. Packet leaves EC2 → SG allows outbound.
2. Route table says **0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway**.
3. NAT Gateway in public subnet sends to IGW.

**On-Premises → AWS via VPN**

1. Data sent from corporate network → VPN tunnel to AWS VGW.
2. VGW routes to correct subnet in VPC.
