**Azure Networking Workflow** i
In Azure terms, we’ll replace **VPC** with **Virtual Network (VNet)**, **Subnets** remain subnets, and the equivalents for IGW, NAT, Transit Gateway, etc., will be used.

## **1. High-Level Azure Networking Workflow**

*(The big picture from VNet creation to connectivity)*

1. **Plan your network architecture**

   * Choose **Azure region(s)**.
   * Define **IP address space** (CIDR notation, e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).
   * Plan **subnets** (front-end, back-end, management, etc.).
   * Decide **availability zones** or paired regions for redundancy.

2. **Create your Virtual Network (VNet)**

   * Assign address space.
   * Enable **DNS resolution** (custom or Azure-provided).

3. **Add subnets**

   * Divide the VNet address space into smaller CIDR blocks.
   * Assign subnets for public workloads, private workloads, and data tiers.

4. **Configure internet connectivity**

   * For public workloads → **Public IP + Network Security Group (NSG)**.
   * Optionally configure **Azure NAT Gateway** for outbound-only access from private subnets.

5. **Set up routing**

   * System routes (automatic) handle basic traffic.
   * Add **User-Defined Routes (UDR)** for custom paths (e.g., through a firewall).

6. **Implement security controls**

   * **NSGs** (subnet/VM level).
   * **Azure Firewall** or **Network Virtual Appliance (NVA)** for advanced security.

7. **Enable hybrid or multi-VNet connectivity**

   * **VNet Peering** (intra-region or global).
   * **Azure VPN Gateway** or **ExpressRoute** for on-premises connectivity.

8. **Test & monitor**

   * Deploy VMs in test subnets.
   * Verify access control and routing.
   * Enable **Network Watcher** for diagnostics.

## **2. Detailed Azure Networking Build Flow (Step-by-Step)**

**Step 1 – VNet Creation**

* In Azure Portal → “Create Virtual Network.”
* Set **address space** (CIDR).
* Choose **Region**.
* Select subscription & resource group.

**Step 2 – Subnet Creation**

* Create subnets with **name** and **address range**.
* Public subnet: Used for internet-facing resources (assign public IPs).
* Private subnet: Internal-only workloads.

**Step 3 – Internet Connectivity**

* For public resources: Assign **Public IP Address**.
* Use **Azure-provided default routes** for outbound internet traffic.
* For private resources needing outbound internet → Deploy **NAT Gateway** in a public subnet.

**Step 4 – Routing**

* Review **effective routes** in Network Interface settings.
* If needed, create **UDR** with next hop (e.g., firewall, NVA, VPN).

**Step 5 – Security**

* Create **NSGs** with inbound/outbound rules.
* Associate NSGs with subnets or individual NICs.
* Use **Azure Firewall** for centralized security policies.

**Step 6 – Hybrid / Multi-VNet**

* Configure **VNet Peering** for Azure-only connections.
* Set up **VPN Gateway** or **ExpressRoute** for on-premises.

**Step 7 – Test & Monitor**

* Deploy **test VMs** in different subnets.
* Test ping, RDP/SSH, and application access.
* Enable **Network Watcher** tools like Connection Monitor and NSG Flow Logs.

## **3. Azure Networking Operational Flow (How Traffic Moves)**

**Public Subnet VM → Internet**

1. Packet leaves VM → NSG outbound rule check.
2. System route sends `0.0.0.0/0` to internet via public IP.
3. Azure fabric handles SNAT/DNAT for public IP translation.

**Private Subnet VM → Internet (via NAT Gateway)**

1. Packet leaves VM → NSG outbound check.
2. Route sends traffic to NAT Gateway.
3. NAT Gateway SNATs and forwards traffic to internet.

**On-Premises → Azure via VPN Gateway**

1. Data leaves on-premises firewall to **Azure VPN Gateway** over IPsec tunnel.
2. VPN Gateway routes traffic to correct VNet subnet.
